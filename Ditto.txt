Ditto eng ver.

Woo woo woo woo ooh
Woo woo woo woo
Stay in the middle
Like you a little
Don't want no riddle
Say it say it back
Oh say it ditto
Can't wait till the morning
So say it ditto

My feelings for you
Like the memories we share
Have grown so big
Summer's already gone and it's autumn
Been waiting all this time
Do you want somebody
Like I want somebody
You smiled at me but
Do you think about me now yeah
All the time yeah
All the time

I got no time to lose
I had a long day
I miss you
Ra-ta-ta-ta echoes my heart (Ra-ta-ta-ta)
I got nothing to lose
I like you wooah wooah wooah
Ra-ta-ta-ta echoes my heart (Ra-ta-ta-ta)
But I don't want to

Stay in the middle
Like you a little
Don't want no riddle
Say it say it back
Oh say it ditto
Can't wait till the morning
So say it ditto
I don't want to
Walk in this maze
Not that I know everything but
Just as I want it
Say it say it back
Oh say it ditto
I want you so, want you
So say it ditto

Not just anybody
I imagined you
With the feeling
That's been always there I've been
Waiting all this time

I got nothing to lose
I like you wooah wooah wooah
Ra-ta-ta-ta echoes my heart (Ra-ta-ta-ta)
But I don't want to

Stay in the middle
Like you a little
Don't want no riddle
Say it say it back
Oh say it ditto
Can't wait till the morning
So say it ditto
I don't want to
Walk in this maze
Not that I know everything but
Just as I want it
Say it say it back
Oh say it ditto
I want you so, want you
So say it ditto

Woo woo woo woo ooh
Woo woo woo woo
